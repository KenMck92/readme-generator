# README-Generator

## Description
    Included the packages needed to run the readme-generator. Created an array of questions for the user using inquirer.prompt to show questions in the terminal when node is ran. Created a writeTOFile to write answers to questions on a generated README file. In the generateMarkdown file I created a function to return the data from my index.js file to my markdown file.
